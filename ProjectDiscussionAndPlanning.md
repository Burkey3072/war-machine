# Project Discussion and Planning

### Effective Communication and Collaboration

The following is an outline of general expectations:

1. Keep up with soft deadlines set within the team. Treat it like the final deadline.
2. It is important that the team at least tries to show up to meetings.
3. Communicate if you are unable to complete something on time so you can get help on it.
4. Being interested in the project is a great way to encourage efficiency and collaborative spirit. If there are any readings, do them.
5. Do things that you are good at so we have a good deliverable. That does not mean that work is delegated unreasonably or disproportionately, however.
6. We will be doing accountability checks, rather than full-scale meetings. The team agrees that longer meetings are counter-productive unless they are meant for discussion. Most communication can be done via messaging. This accountability check is scheduled weekly on Tuesdays at 3 pm.
7. We will avoid working last minute.
8. While meetings will not be enforced, one-on-one in-person or virtual meetings are encouraged between two or more people working on something large or potentially complicated.
   

### Project Goals

1. Design a model to valuate the risk of war, given a graph network of alliances and enmities, focusing on international conflicts.
2. Venture out, if possible, to other predictive analytics relevant to the primary goal, like modeling war from economic growth, or the lack thereof. **This is not our priority.**
3. Eventually delve into, if possible, civil conflicts and intranational unrest, as well as the effect of local economies as a lone predictor of conflict. **This is not our priority.**
4. Back our findings and models with a strong mathematical background.


### Evolving Roles

These will keep changing as we progress.

1. Kyle Cowden -  Mathematical Background, Initial Predictive Algorithm, and Evolution Algorithm.
2. Lowell Monis - Predictive Machine Learning Methods, Mathematical Assistance, Data Collection
3. Joseph Burke - Data Collection and Processing, Miscellaneous Machine Learning Techniques
4. Saif Sheikh - Miscellaneous Machine Learning Techniques

Each member will be responsible for presenting their work
