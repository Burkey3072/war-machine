# War Machine

This repository was created for a semester project in Michigan State University's CMSE 202, Computational Modeling Tools and Techniques during the Fall of 2024 taught by Dr. Nathan Haut at the Department of Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering.

This project aims to predict which countries will go to war using computational models, agent-based models, and graph theory. 

This project comes under the social sciences.
